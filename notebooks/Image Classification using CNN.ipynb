    "CNNs use a variation of multilayer perceptrons designed to require minimal preprocessing.[1] They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks (SIANN), based on their shared-weights architecture and translation invariance characteristics ...\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs use relatively little pre-processing compared to other image classification algorithms. This means that the network learns the filters that in traditional algorithms were hand-engineered. This independence from prior knowledge and human effort in feature design is a major advantage.- Wikipedia"

    "> Unlike traditional Neural Networks where all layers are fully-meshed, CNNs are much efficient because it uses a variation of partially-meshed multilayer perceptrons designed to require minimal preprocessing. Also the manual, time-consuming, and very subjective feature engineering of the images typically associated in traditional NN designs doesn’t apply to CNN because they are built-in the training process.  And finally, CNN’s convolved features of low-dimension matrices, the by-product output weights of the middle layers, are spatial invariant.  This is a significant because entities, texts, or objects could be tagged similar regardless of size, orientation, and spatial position in the image."
